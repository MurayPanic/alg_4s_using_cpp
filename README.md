# Solving programming assignments in Algorithm 4th edition with C++
This respository contains solutions for the assignments for the Algorithm
course on Coursera( [Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)).
It is implemented using C++ therefore it may not be uploaded on the Coursera platform.

# Why doing the assigments with C++?
For one thing, I am not familar with Java. 

For another, I find it a good way to practise C++. Because 

- There is no available solution in C++ on the network and in case that I would like to look for suggested solution, 
I can only refer to java code. Even though the Java and C++ are very similar on grammar, I provide me space for practising.
- The assignments provide good opertunities to explore latest C++'s feature in various task.

# Any disadvantages?
You may be too focused on the implementation and neglect the algorithm itself.
But that is the characteristic of C++, it draw too much attention from programmers to the implementation. If you are focusing
on learing alogrithms, doing the assignments in C++ may not be a good practise.

# What do I learn about C++ after finished the assignments
I got a deeper understanding on some concepts in C++ and the usage of various C++ code. I saw them before on **C++ Primer**, but
not quite understand and don't know how to use. 

What I learned include:
- How to compile C++ file with command line;
- Knowing the differences between version of C++ standards;
- Knowing the differences between differenc C++ compilers;
- Try generic programming with template;
- Defining class 
- Reloading operators
- Writing multi-thread programs with the **std::thread** library
- Wrting thread-safe programw with the **std::mutex** library
- Process with standard I/O
- Process with files using the **std::filesystem** library
- Write unit tests with the **Google Test Framework**
- Process string rapidly with **std::ranges** library
- Perform compiel-time validation of template with **std::concept**library
